## mini version of huffman contest

compress the contents of [**hutter price FAQ**](http://prize.hutter1.net/hfaq.htm#about) into pure python with no imports or execs.

## rules
the rules are: compress content of [book](./book) as much as possible. The compressed result must be an executable python file that prints the exact book content when executed.

look into [huffman.py](./huffman.py) for a simple compression example.
